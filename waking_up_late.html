    <h1>Waking Up Early VS. Staying Up Late</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Staying Up Late is Actualy Better than Waking up Early</h2>
      <h2>Study and Work</h2>
      <p>
        For a starter, and especially for students who have to juggle work and
        their school, staying up late to do homework is ideal. Throughout the
        day students get the chance to finish their work outside school and
        attend their classes and at night they get to finish the homework they
        have. For many students this way is a good way to balance school and
        work life.

      <h2>Night Life</h2>
      <p>
        Not only students benefit from staying up late, but people who enjoy the
        beautiful city at night scenery also agree that staying up late is worth
        it. If you know the safe places many would agree that the city is way
        more cool and vibrant at night than the quiet and empty morning. Waking
        up early doesn’t give you the chance to experience the city at night
        because you’ll be worried about your sleep schedule the whole time. Even
        if you don’t live in a vibrant and lively city, the night sky’s beauty
        is a strong enough reason to stay up late and just watch. Staying up at
        night can also be calm and quiet.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Staying up late is actually better than waking up early. It allows you
        to accomplish the things that you didn’t get to throughout the day and
        to view a beautiful city or sky at night. There are many thing you can
        do at night that you can’t do if you wake up early in the morning.
