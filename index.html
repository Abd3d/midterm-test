    <h1>Waking Up Early VS. Staying Up Late</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Waking Up Early is Better Than Staying Up Late</h2>
      <h2>Time</h2>
      <p>
        To start off, waking up early allows you to do so many things that you
        won’t be able to do if you wake up late and have to rush to get ready to
        go to school or work. Who doesn’t want to start off their day doing yoga
        and relaxing while it’s calm and quite? To add to that, it’s probably
        really beneficial for university/ college students to wake up early
        because it would give them so much time to review their course
        materials. Or, it could also give them time just to relax so they can
        concentrate when they need to in classes.

      <h2>Calm</h2>
      <p>
        A morning jog while everyone else is most likely sleeping and it’s calm
        and quite outside, sounds like an ideal start of the day for many
        people. Waking up early gives you the opportunity to do just that! That
        quite environment, again, is especially beneficial for pre secondary
        students. With the quieter environment, pre-secondary students can study
        with more focus and in a more efficient manner.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Waking up early has so many benefits in contrast to staying up late.
        Waking up early gives you so much time to get prepared and ready for the
        day and allows you to enjoy a peaceful and quite environment outside.
        There is no reason to stay up late when you can sleep early and enjoy
        all the benefits of waking up early.
